# jQuery UI Autocomplete
 
 I remember seeing in the forum that you never got on with jQuery UI Autocomplete, but it works fine for me in many places across my site.

Crucially, in my usage, Autocomplete is customizable to enable additional (disambiguating) data to be displayed. You can see it in action here:
www.dbopm.com/Public/Artists
and use the "Artist name lookup" button to find the name "Casey". The two Al Caseys are easily distinguishable.

However, I can't find a way to incorporate this technique if I use jQ UI Autocomplete in DT Editor.
