# DataTables
 
 I have a button triggering "hideSelectedRows" which hides "selected" rows by applying the "noDisplay" class to the relevant tr element(s).

I now need to test for the existence of the "noDisplay" class when using other button functions. For example, "openChildRowsForSelectedRows" is working. However, in "openAllChildRows" I can't figure out how to retrieve the tr element.
